      <h1>About UBC Access Map</h1>
      <p>
        A student-built campus directory for finding a washroom when you need one, with
        accessibility facts kept separate from community taste.

      <h2>How ranking works</h2>
      <p>
        Verified UBC emails can rate cleanliness, privacy, availability, and overall experience.
        Those scores are combined with a Bayesian prior so one 5-star vote cannot create an S
        rank. Accessibility fields are never inferred from popularity.
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        We store a hashed magic-link token and a session cookie. Display names are generated from
        the email local part. Student numbers and ID images are not collected. Email verification
        shows affiliation with an allowed UBC domain; it does not prove current enrolment.
